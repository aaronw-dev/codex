# Codex

## Inspiration
The inspiration for this app came from our own experiences learning to code. Traditional methods often were unengaging, boring and sometimes complex. So we envisioned an educational tool that keeps users engaged and motivated as they progress through their coding journey. We achieved this vision by incorporating elements of gamification coupled with a simple but engaging UI, 

## What it does
CodeX is an interactive learning experience. It aims to teach users the basics of programming through simple engaging lessons and practical applications.

## How we built it
We used Figma to design the UI and UX, then those designs were implemented with vanilla HTML and CSS.
Functionality was made possible with Javascript and Firebase (for storing lesson structure)

## Challenges we ran into
Run out of time to implement social features e.g leaderboards

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating a unique and engaging UX and UI
Creating an effective lesson structure

## What we learned
Throughout the development of this project, we learned how to build a progressive web app for mobile deployment (our main target audience). We also learned how to implement a creative UX that rivals most  coding teaching platforms. 

## What's next for CodeX
Deploying it on Web officially
Adding more courses
Adding more social features (e.g leaderboard, daily streak, etc)
