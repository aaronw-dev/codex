# Testing some Vercel stuff for my website.

This is just a test repository for use with my website in the future.

## Demo

https://vercel.awdev.codes

## How it Works

This example uses the Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) with Flask to enable handling requests on Vercel with Serverless Functions.

Yep. Thanks!

## Running Locally

```bash
npm i -g vercel
vercel dev
```
